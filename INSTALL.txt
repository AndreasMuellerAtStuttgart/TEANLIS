To install the framework, just download the classes and integrate them, for example, in an eclipse-project as the source of the project. To make use of all of the classes in the framework, you need to include the following jar-libraries in your, for example, eclipse Build Path (or the equivalent in the development environment of your choice):

1. From GATE Developer, all libraries in the lib-folder where you installed GATE
2. From GATE Developer, all libraries in the bin-folder where you installed GATE
3. opennlp-maxent-3.0.3.jar from the OpenNLP tools
4. opennlp-tools-1.5.3.jar from the OpenNLP tools
5. anna-3.6.1.jar from the mate tools
