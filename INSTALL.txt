To install the framework, just download the classes and integrate them, for example, in an eclipse-project as the source of the project. To make use of all of the classes in the framework, you need to include the following jar-libraries in your, for example, eclipse Build Path (or the equivalent in the development environment of your choice):

1. From GATE Developer, all libraries in the lib-folder where you installed GATE
2. From GATE Developer, all libraries in the bin-folder where you installed GATE
3. opennlp-maxent-3.0.3.jar from the OpenNLP tools
4. opennlp-tools-1.5.3.jar from the OpenNLP tools
5. anna-3.6.1.jar from the mate tools
6. weka.jar from weka

You can get those libraries from:

1. GATE from https://gate.ac.uk/download/ or just google GATE download
2. OpenNLP tools from https://opennlp.apache.org/cgi-bin/download.cgi or google Apache OpenNLP
3. anna-3.6.1.jar from https://code.google.com/p/mate-tools/downloads/list or google mate tools
4. weka.jar from http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html or google weka machine learning. Get version 3.7.10 if possible
