TEANLIS
=======

Code for the TEANLIS (Text Analysis for Literary Scholars) framework. Please note that for some classes (see INSTALL.txt) you need to download other libraries and you need to check that their licenses are compatible with what you want to do with the code. However, as far as I understand those licenses as long as you use them for research purposes only you should have no problems with the licenses. I can't make any guarantuees that the licenses are compatible with what you want to use the code for though. At the time of writing the licenses of additional libraries you need for some of the classes (you can use many of the classes without additional libraries):

1. GPL (General Public License)
2. Lesser GPL
3. Apache License, Version 2.0
